Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^

We made some tutorial examples:

- `Tutorial 1 <tutorial-1-ffd.html>`_ shows how to apply the free-form deformation to mesh nodes.
- `Turorial 2 <tutorial-2-iges.html>`_ shows how to deal with iges (CAD) files and FFD.
- `Turorial 3 <tutorial-3-rbf.html>`_ shows how to apply the radial basis function to mesh nodes.
- `Turorial 4 <tutorial-4-idw.html>`_ shows how to perform a deformation using the inverse distance weighting method to mesh nodes.
- `Turorial 5 <tutorial-5-file.html>`_ shows how to perform a deformation to an object stored in a file.
- `Turorial 6 <tutorial-6-ffd-rbf.html>`_ shows deforming a computational mesh.
