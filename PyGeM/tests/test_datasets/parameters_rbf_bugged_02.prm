[Radial Basis Functions]
# This section describes the radial basis functions shape.

# basis funtion is the name of the basis functions to use in the transformation. The functions
# implemented so far are: gaussian_spline, multi_quadratic_biharmonic_spline,
# inv_multi_quadratic_biharmonic_spline, thin_plate_spline, beckert_wendland_c2_basis.
# For a comprehensive list with details see the class RBF.
basis function: gaussian_splines

# radius is the scaling parameter r that affects the shape of the basis functions. See the documentation
# of the class RBF for details.
radius: 0.5


[Control points]
# This section describes the RBF control points.

# original control points collects the coordinates of the interpolation control points before the deformation.
