[Box info]
# This section collects all the properties of the FFD bounding box.

# n control points indicates the number of control points in each direction (x, y, z).
# For example, to create a 2 x 3 x 2 grid, use the following: n control points: 2, 3, 2
n control points x: 3
n control points y: 2
n control points z: 2

# box length indicates the length of the FFD bounding box along the three canonical directions (x, y, z).
# It uses the local coordinate system.
# For example to create a 2 x 1.5 x 3 meters box use the following: box length: 2.0, 1.5, 3.0
box length x: 45.0
box length y: 90.0
box length z: 90.0

# box origin indicates the x, y, and z coordinates of the origin of the FFD bounding box. That is center of
# rotation of the bounding box. It corresponds to the point coordinates with position [0][0][0].
# See section "Parameters weights" for more details.
# For example, if the origin is equal to 0., 0., 0., use the following: box origin: 0., 0., 0.
box origin x: -20.0
box origin y: -55.0
box origin z: -45.0

# rotation angle indicates the rotation angle around the x, y, and z axis of the FFD bounding box in degrees.
# The rotation is done with respect to the box origin.
# For example, to rotate the box by 2 deg along the z direction, use the following: rotation angle: 0., 0., 2.
rotation angle x: 20.3
rotation angle y: 11.0
rotation angle z: 0.0


[Parameters weights]
# This section describes the weights of the FFD control points.
# We adopt the following convention:
# For example with a 2x2x2 grid of control points we have to fill a 2x2x2 matrix of weights.
# If a weight is equal to zero you can discard the line since the default is zero.
#
# | x index | y index | z index | weight |
#  --------------------------------------
# |    0    |    0    |    0    |  1.0   |
# |    0    |    1    |    1    |  0.0   | --> you can erase this line without effects
# |    0    |    1    |    0    | -2.1   |
# |    0    |    0    |    1    |  3.4   |
